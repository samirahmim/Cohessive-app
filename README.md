# Cohessive-app
2.1 SD lab project.

Imagine doing last minute calculations and you have to search for small things,
instead of searching for the small handy applications every time what if an app had
all of them together for easier access in the time of need? From that thought we
designed the Cohesive App. It is a student friendly app that helps in studying and
to keep track of things in order to organize.
We have used JavaFX, MySQL database and NetBeans IDE to develop this
application which consists a list of handy apps such as a calculator, converter,
calendar, event-planner and stopwatch. The App registers different personâ€™s data
for different people to login and have separate accounts.
